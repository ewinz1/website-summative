                Samdoesarts is a youtube-based digital artist living in Toronto.
                His unique style consists of many different characteristics, such as
                angular facial features and high-contrast, stylized lighting. Something
                remarkable about Sam's style is that he can combine artistic elements 
                from realism and cartoon techniques without letting his drawings
                look artificial or forced. All of his characters, who are mainly
                female, look natural and elegant. Learn more about Sam
